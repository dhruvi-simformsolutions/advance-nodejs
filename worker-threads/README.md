## What is a Worker Thread in Node.js?

A Worker Thread in Node.js allows for parallel execution of JavaScript code in multiple threads, enabling Node.js to offload CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main event loop. This is particularly useful for tasks like complex calculations or file processing that would otherwise block the main thread and degrade performance.

Node.js is single-threaded by default, meaning it processes tasks in sequence on a single thread. However, with worker threads, you can delegate certain tasks to separate threads so that the main thread can continue to handle I/O operations or other tasks.

## Why Use Worker Threads?

Concurrency: Perform CPU-intensive tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
Efficiency: Offload long-running tasks to separate threads, freeing up the main thread for non-blocking I/O operations.
Parallelism: Execute multiple tasks in parallel, which can significantly improve performance for compute-heavy applications.

## Benefits of Worker Threads:

Non-blocking: Worker threads allow the main thread to remain unblocked, even when performing CPU-intensive tasks.
Parallel Execution: Multiple worker threads can run in parallel to speed up the execution of tasks.
Better Utilization of Multi-core CPUs: Workers can run on different CPU cores, improving overall performance for tasks that can be parallelized.

## When to Use Worker Threads:

Heavy Computations: Offload heavy mathematical operations, data processing, or other CPU-bound tasks.
Data Processing: When handling large datasets or performing operations like image processing, encryption, etc.
Avoiding Main Thread Blocking: When you need to keep the event loop responsive while executing long-running operations.
